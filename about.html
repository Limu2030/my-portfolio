    <p class="about">
      My name is Lillian Muita a nature enthusiast and lover of music plus
      cuisines from other cultures Ever since i can remember I have always
      wanted to change the lives of people in my community especially the
      vulnerable. I believe we were all put on earth for a reason; to help each
      other. It was this passion for community development that pushed me to
      pursue International Relation Studies as i was seeking answers to better
      my world. This remains my goal to this day and one of the biggest
      contributors why i decided to be a software developer. If the events from
      the last two years have taught us anything, it's that there is a strong
      need for an international perspective and a more global vision, to better
      understand the conflicts and challenges surrounding us. One major
      consequence of the pandemic was a blow to traditional ways of doing things
      that we were accustomed to. How then can we remain relevant? How else can
      we impact our world? How else can we develop? I chose to code. Through
      coding i can continue to be part of the solution to the ever evolving now
      digital globe.
