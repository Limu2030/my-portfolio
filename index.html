      <p class="about">
        My name is Lillian Muita a nature enthusiast and lover of music plus
        cuisines from other cultures. <br />
        Ever since I can remember I have always wanted to change the lives of
        people in my community especially the vulnerable. I believe we were all
        put on earth for a reason; to help each other. It was this passion for
        community development that pushed me to pursue International Relation
        Studies as i was seeking answers to better my world. This remains my
        goal to this day and one of the biggest contributors why I decided to be
        a software developer. If the events from the last two years have taught
        us anything, it's that there is a strong need for an international
        perspective and a more global vision, to better understand the conflicts
        and challenges surrounding us. One major consequence of the pandemic was
        a blow to traditional ways of doing things that we were accustomed to.
        How then can we remain relevant? How else can we impact our world? How
        else can we develop? I chose to code. Through coding I can continue to
        be part of the solution to the ever evolving now digital globe.
